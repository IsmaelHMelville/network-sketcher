## Procedure
1. **Generate equipment port management table**.
    1. Export device files with reference to [[2-4 Exporting Device Files]](https://github.com/cisco-open/network-sketcher/blob/main/User_Guide/English/2-4%20Exporting%20Device%20Files.pdf)


1. **Update [L3 Table] sheet VPN**

    1. Decide the host name and L3 interface name for the VPN termination from "Device Name" and "L3 Port Name".

       - If the L3 interface in question is a virtual IF, the L3 virtual interface must be defined in the L2 configuration in advance
    1. Enter the hostname and L3 interface name of the VPN counterpart in the "[VPN] Target Device Name" and "[VPN] Target L3 Port Name" columns

        - [Add ver 2.3.2] If you want to reflect VPNs as segments in the Layer 3 configuration diagram, please create both Source IFs and Target IFs in the [L2 Table] sheet with Loopback (L3) in advance.<br>

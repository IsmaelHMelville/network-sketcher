## What you can do with this procedure.
* **Load the master data into Network Sketcher and automatically assign an IP address.**
- This feature automates the following tasks
  - Aggregate IP address usage of other locations and assign new locations from similar ranges.
  - Check that the IP address range to be assigned does not overlap with the IP address ranges of all locations.
  - Reflect the specification of the number of free IP addresses in the subnet mask to be assigned.
  - If only one part of the IP address is included, supplement the rest and pay out IP ranges that are also close to each other within the base.
  - Reflect ascending/descending order rule.

## Option Description
- Range Settings
  - Starting point of IP address network (CIDR): The starting IP address range to which an IP is assigned; candidates are entered when an Area is selected, but can also be specified.
  - Number of free IP addresses in each segment: Specify the number of free IP addresses to be provided in each Layer 3 segment.

- Numbering rules
  - Ascending or descending order: 
    - Ascending order: Set IP assignment in ascending order (.1->.2.->3 ... etc.)
    - Descending order: Set IP assignment in descending order (.254->.253.->252 ... etc.) 

- Completion of missing IP addresses
  - Within the same layer 3 segment:
    - Keep existing IP address: Preserves the IP address if one part of the IP address configuration exists in the Layer 3 segment.
    - Reassign within the same subnet: If one part of an IP address setting exists in a Layer 3 segment, setting whether the IP address is reassigned based on ascending or descending order settings.
